    <p id='F_A_Q'>Where are you currently making your products? <br>
Answer: We have an office facility in New York. <br>
What will you use my investment for? <br>
Answer: Access more schools, increase our sales, go worldwide, and create more extensions if possible. <br>
Do you currently have any sales? <br>
Answer: We have a chart that illustrates our sales since the beginning of our company. <br>
Do you currently have any other patents or businesses? <br>
Answer: No. However, we plan to after we get your investment if you allow of course. <br>
Are you going to sell online or in brick and mortars(physical shops)? <br>
Answer: Our plan is to advertise our products online. We will display a video of a teacher who is struggling to equally divert <br> her attention from her NetOp app and her mini-group lesson. Then an ad will appear on her computer screen and she will see <br> herself using our app. In the end, we will spin into the screen and present a video that describes the problem, solution, <br> and how we came up with this solution. <br>
What are your profit margins? <br>
Answer: 100% profit margin (Highest possible is 99.99%(Ask Vaibhav for reasons why)) <br>
How do you plan on advertising your product? <br>
Answer: via social media.  Our plan is to advertise our products online. We will display a video of a teacher who is struggling <br> to equally divert her attention from her NetOp app and her mini-group lesson. Then an ad will appear on her computer screen <br> and she will see herself using our app. In the end, we will spin into the screen and present a video that describes the <br> problem, solution, and how we came up with this solution. <br>
What was the most challenging task you faced as an inventor? <br>
Answer: Trying to make our product unique- We knew that there was already NetOp and probably another hundred other student <br> vision apps. After some discussion, we came up with Pupil. “See all, know all.” <br>
What is unique about your company? <br>
Answer: We did not just monitor students’ screens, we are also constantly checking students’ history, and we send messages to <br> the teacher at the first sight of trouble (31+ seconds or any activity on any website, we send a message to the teacher, <br> and if the teacher agrees, we send a message to the parent automatically!) <br>
What big problem does this solve? <br>
Answer: We just stopped hundreds of students from not focusing in class and going on websites that they are not supposed to be <br> on. We also stopped the fact that teachers have to divert some of their attention to their NetOp and just gave them the <br> ability to divert ALL of their attention to their lesson. <br>
What age demographic would be your primary market? <br>
Answer: We are trying to appeal to teachers and principals nationwide. <br>
What have you learned from this experience? <br>
Answer: You can always improve what already exists in front of you. <br>
Part A: Do you have any competition? <br>
Answer: NetOp Student Vision <br>
Part B: If so, what advantage do you have over them? <br>
Answer: We have a stronger security system than our opponents.	We automatically report any activity, and we block websites with <br> no password. Only the teacher can go through a two-step authorization feature. The first step is a pin and the second step <br> is a personal question but the good thing is that we do not collect any personal info. <br>
Additional Questions: <br>
How did you think of this app? <br>
Answer: We thought of problems and their solutions. After a while, we came up with Pupil. <br>
