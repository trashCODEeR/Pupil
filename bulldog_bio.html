    <h3>Bulldog - The app that protects students and adults alike from viruses.</h3>
    <p>Bulldog stores the original state of the machine in one file and then compares <br> it with the curent machine state. If the state of the current machine does not match the control file, then it will automatically alert <br>the user.</p>

        <h4>The end can always be the beginning...</h4>
        <p>It all started when one of our computers all of a sudden broke down and we realized <br>someone may have just downloaded a virus somehow... From that moment on (after we got a new computer), we decided to put our best effort into developing software that compared <br>the original or control machine state to the current state of the machine. If a virus is detected (the machine state). <br>Then it will automatically freeze the machine state and work on neutralizing the virus(viruses).</p>
