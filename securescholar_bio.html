        <h3>SecureScholar - The app that monitors and assists students in browsing the web safely.</h3>
        <p>We came up with Secure Scholar after we noticed that NetOp Student Vision was only <br> effective at monitoring the screen. A fateful mistake that gave us an edge in the race to perfect screen monitoring.</p>
        <p>Our SecureScholar app compares the list of urls that the teacher has allowed the student <br> to go on to the one that the student is on. This method is foolproof as the url tells everything about the website.</p>

            <p>It all started in the classroom with our teacher Ms. Young. She had challenged us to think <br> of something that hadn't been invented before. We had sat there all day until discussion led us away from SOS watches to technology. <br>And then we struck gold. We realized the problem with NetOp Student Vision was that it only monitored the screen(s). <br> And for teachers, that was a major flaw. Teachers were always everywhere and nowhere. They could only either teach their students, look for lesson material, or monitor the screen. <br>As you can see, NetOp did have a major flaw. That was when we knew that we had to compare the url(s) of the student's tabs to a list of eligible and teacher-approved lists. <br>We knew that urls told everything about the website. From where to go on the website, to how to display the webpage. That was how SecureScholar was created.</p>
