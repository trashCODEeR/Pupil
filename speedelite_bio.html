        <h3>SpeedElite - The app that speeds up your computer.</h3>
        <p>SpeedElite is an app that uninstalls unecessary or suspicious apps that might be <br>slowing down your computer. If you don't want it uninstalling apps that you need, it can just warn you of apps that could potentially be <br>using too much of your memory.</p>
        <div id='SpeedElite bio'>
            <p>When our computers started slowing down, we knew that there had to be a solution to this. <br>Day and night we thought about a potential solution. And then we had an ah-hah! <br>moment and realized that if you compare the two speeds (the control speed and the current speed) then you would be able find a problem. <br>Then I incorparated some Bulldog code <a href="bulldog_bio.html">Bulldog bio</a>  and designed some code that would locate files and apps that you did not use and ask you <br> which ones you wanted to uninstall and which ones you wanted to keep.</p>
